        <div class="poem-space">
<textarea placeholder="Purple is the colour I learned love through.
Not the kind that burns fast and disappears,
But the kind that settles in your chest
And teaches your heart how to stay.

It lives in the space where your laughter meets my peace,
Where your presence quiets every doubt I’ve ever carried.
Loving you doesn’t feel like falling
It feels like arriving.

Purple is patience.
It’s choosing you in the small moments,
In the silences,
In the days that don’t sparkle
But still matter.

It’s the way my love for you isn’t loud
Yet it’s constant.
It doesn’t demand,
It protects.
It doesn’t fade,
It deepens.

When I love you, I love you like purple loves the sky
Blending gently, never forcing,
Turning ordinary evenings into something sacred.
You don’t have to try to be anything for me.
You already are everything.

My love for you is in the staying,
In the listening,
In the way your happiness feels like my responsibility
And your pain feels personal.

If love had a home,
It would be here
In purple sunsets,
In shared favourite colours,
In a future I quietly imagine
With you in every version of it.

Purple is us.
And loving you is the most natural thing
My heart has ever known.💜"></textarea>

<textarea placeholder="My love,

There are moments when words feel too small to carry what I feel for you, yet I try, because loving you deserves to be spoken. You have a way of making the world feel softer, kinder, more alive. When I’m with you, everything settles into place, as if my heart finally remembers where it belongs.

You are my calm and my excitement, my laughter and my quiet comfort. In your presence, even ordinary moments become something I want to hold onto forever.

My heart chooses you, again and again, without hesitation. Today, tomorrow, and in every moment that follows.✨"></textarea>

<textarea placeholder="My Valentine, From Afar

Even though we are miles apart,
I feel you in every quiet moment.
I hear your laughter in the hum of the day,
and I see your smile in every small joy.

Valentine’s Day is meant for closeness,
for holding hands, for shared glances,
but even in absence, you are here.
You are in my heartbeat, in my breath, in my thoughts.

I miss the warmth of your touch,
the way your hand fits perfectly in mine,
the way your voice can make everything feel calm,
even across mountains and time zones.

I imagine the day I can see you again,
and it keeps me going through every lonely moment.
Until then, I carry you with me,
in messages, in dreams, in the silent spaces of my day.

You are my Valentine not because of roses or chocolates,
not because of tradition or expectation,
but because of the way you make me feel alive,
the way love becomes real and tangible
even when you are far away.

I love you in the mornings I wake
and the nights I lie awake thinking of you.
I love you in the songs I hear
and in the quiet whispers I wish I could share.

Distance cannot lessen what I feel for you.
It cannot dim the light you’ve brought into my life.
You are my heart, my home, my constant,
and today, like every day,
I celebrate you,
I celebrate us,
I celebrate the love that no distance can take away.💫"></textarea>

<textarea placeholder="Hey my love,

I just want you to know how deeply I love you, more than words ever really manage to say. You are so incredibly strong, even on the days you don’t feel like it, and I admire that about you more than you’ll ever know. Watching you face the world with your heart, your kindness, and your resilience has changed me in ways I didn’t expect.

You’ve made my life better just by being in it. You’ve brought me peace where there used to be noise, comfort where there used to be stress, and happiness in moments I didn’t even know were missing something. Being with you feels like home...safe, warm, and real.

Thank you for being you. Thank you for loving me, for choosing me, and for sharing your world with me. I’m so grateful for every moment we spend together, and I can’t wait for all the memories still waiting for us. I love you more than I could ever fully explain.

Always yours 💜"></textarea>
